### notes:

- [implementation of heap in go](../lib/heap.go)
- heaps are a good data structure when we want to find the minimum or maximum of a stream of data in low
  time `O(1) for getting min/max`.
- However, keeping the heap update may be challenging when the value of each data changes over
  time `O(n) for searching for a value and O(logn) for replacing it`
- one way of handling this is to not keep the heap inconsistent with the old data and check it when the min/max is being
  retrieved.
